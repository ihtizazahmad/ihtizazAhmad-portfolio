          At <strong>I,Ni Habesha</strong>, we believe food is more than sustenance—it’s a universal language that unites cultures, ignites memories, and uplifts the spirit. Inspired by global travels and rooted in the ideals of Rastafarian oneness, our journey began in Atlanta with a vision to fuse the flavors, rhythms, and energies of the world into one unforgettable experience. From the vibrant streets of Jamaica and Nigeria to the soulful vibes of Southern Louisiana and Eritrea, every dish and every sound tells a story. We invite you to explore a space where culinary artistry meets cultural expression—where the essence of Roots Rock, Reggae, and rainforest serenity comes alive through taste, sound, and ambiance.
